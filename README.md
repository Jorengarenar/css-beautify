# CSS Beautifier

This repository exist solely for installing `css-beautify` without the need of
`npm`

All I have done is extracting it from official repository and preparing it work
without installing `js-beautify` through `npm`

This is by any means my work. All credits goes there:
[beautify-web/js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify)

## Installation

If you are on Arch Linux and don't mind having `python-jsbeautifier` installed
as dependency you can use this
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/css-beautify)

Otherwise clone this repository and from inside of it execute with root privileges:
```sh
make install
```
